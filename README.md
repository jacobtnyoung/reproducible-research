# **Reproducible Research using Markdown and GitHub**

This page is for the ASU CCJ SIMD Workshop. We will discuss why you should consider doing reproducible research and how to do it using Markdown and Github.

## **Reproducible Research**

### *What is it?*  

  + Documented Workflow: Reproducible research involves thoroughly documenting your research workflow, including data collection, data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, in a clear and organized manner.
  
  + Open Access to Data: It entails making your raw data, code, and supplementary materials openly accessible to others, typically through repositories or platforms, to enable others to replicate your work.
  
  + Version Control: Using version control systems allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate.
  
  + Automation: Reproducible research often involves automating data processing and analysis steps through scripts or pipelines, reducing the risk of manual errors and ensuring consistency.

### *Why is it important?*  

  + Learning Best Practices: Practicing reproducible research teaches best practices in data management, code organization, and documentation.
  
  + Transparency and Accountability: Promotes transparency by allowing others to scrutinize and replicate your work.
  
  + Skill Development: Develop technical skills such as coding, data manipulation, and data visualization, which are transferable to various career paths.
  
  + Efficiency: Streamlines the research process by reducing the time spent on troubleshooting and data management.
  
  + Publication: Journals increasingly require or expect research to be reproducible.
  
  + Future Career Prospects: Demonstrating proficiency in reproducible research practices can make you more competitive in academia, industry, and other research-related fields.
  
  + Ethical Research: Adhering to reproducible practices aligns with ethical standards in research, emphasizing honesty, integrity, and transparency in the research process.

### *How do we do it?*

RMarkdown and GitHub!

<br>

## *What is RMarkdown?*

RMarkdown is a dynamic document format that combines the power of R programming language and Markdown syntax. It allows you to integrate code, text, and visualizations into a single document. RMarkdown documents can be easily converted to various output formats, such as PDF, HTML, Word, and more.  

<br>

### *An example...*

Take a look at the document called ["reproducible-manuscript.pdf"](reproducible-manuscript.pdf).

<br>

### *Features of RMarkdown:* 

  + Code Integration: Embed R code chunks within your document for data analysis and visualization.
 
  + Reproducibility: Ensures that your results are reproducible since readers can see the code and its output.
 
  + Flexibility: Supports various output formats, making it suitable for academic papers, reports, presentations, and more.
 
  + Easy to Learn: Requires minimal coding knowledge, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
 
  + Collaboration: Facilitates collaborative work by combining code, text, and results in one file.
 
  + Customization: Allows you to customize document styles and formatting.

<br>

*Now*, let's take a look at the RMarkdown file that created the manuscript above: ["reproducible-manuscript.Rmd"](reproducible-manuscript.Rmd).

<br>

### *What next?*

Ok, so we have everything documented, now what do we do? Ideally, I could store it online, track the changes that I make, make it available to others to replicate the code, etc.

GitHub does that!

<br>

## ***Working with GitHub***

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform for software development and collaboration. It primarily facilitates version control, project management, and team collaboration for software projects.

If you are saying "I don't develop software, I am done with this page", hold on!

<br>

### *Why use GitHub?*

  + Version Control: GitHub enables you to track changes in your code over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed. This is crucial for maintaining a history of your work and collaborating with others without fear of losing progress.
  
  + Collaboration: Provides tools for multiple individuals to work on the same project simultaneously. Features like pull requests and code reviews make it easy to collaborate with peers or mentors on research projects or assignments. 
  
  + Project Management: The issue tracking system allows you to organize and prioritize tasks, making it a valuable tool for project management.
  
  + Showcasing Work: GitHub serves as an online portfolio of your projects, making it an excellent platform to showcase your skills to potential employers or colleagues.
  
  + Community and Networking: GitHub hosts a vast community of developers and researchers. Engaging with this community can provide valuable insights, feedback, and networking opportunities, which can be beneficial for academic and career growth.

So, for all these reasons (and more!), GitHub is an excellent platform for conducting reproducible research.
